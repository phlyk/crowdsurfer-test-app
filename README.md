# CrowdSurferTest

Finished result of the task I was instructed to do by CrowdSurfer, a single page results viewer of JSON data.
When I say finished I mean as far as I got with as much time as I had, coding is a beautiful thing because you can always improve, always develop and try new things.
I believe I completely what was asked of me to a good standard, I have worked very hard on the project and have been as thorough as I could have been.

## The Task && Structure

-bla components
-bla order
-bla lots to say

## Special Features

-double filter
-filter numbers displayed
-sort ascending/ descending array pipe
potential rewards in modal view
ability to extend each result
-regex to remove `html` tags
-no empty values/descriptions

## Known Issues

Sadly, there were somethings I was not able to solve. Most of these 'bugs' are fairly trivial but required much time which I prioritsed elsewhere. They include:
-Filter options numbers not always being retrieved
-Filter options numbers not accurate when filtering on two variables
-MdSelect placeholder not within SortComponent view, shows as partial text
-MdDialog (modals) have an unnecessary scroll bar on longer rewards
-colour scheme isn't fantastic, sorry about that, my design is unpracticed
-My test doesn't pass =(

## Improvements && Reflections

I loved this task.
I wanted to add multiple views, routing, forms, selection
Working tests and better error handling
Find a way of improving the filter number issue
